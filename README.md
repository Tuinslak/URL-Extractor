# URL Extractor

Attempts to create a list of URLs from files, and checks whether they actually exist/respond before saving them to a file.

# What files ?

Usually log files. 

For example, getting domains from my Bind (DNS) server. But not every domain has a webserver running behind it. 

# Why ?

Populate my GFW-URL-checker's host file (<http://yeri.be/hr>).
